Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA), Government of India, through its Registrar Of Companies (ROC) in different Regions is the governing body for incorporating any new company, enforcing compliance to Companies Act 2013 (Amendment 2014), investigating violations and so forth. 

MCA in its portal (https://mca.gov.in) releases and archives open data about new private limited companies (including one person companies) and limited liability partnership companies, both Indian and Foreign. 

This repository hosts both MCA released data, renamed as "yyyy-Input" and my reformatted data as "yyyy-Output" for Years 2016-2019. 

Due to inconsistency or perhaps lack of schema definition of MCA's dataset, it warranted a schema converter, a VBA script, that's also included in this repository. Though this script takes out some of the manual work, the configuration of location and format of input fields are still cumbersome and any contribution to improve this converter is welcome. 

A dashboard is created per each year's data and consolidated four year data, that's a total of five (5) dashboards. Dashboard is created using Google Data Studio (mainly because it is free!) and the visualizations are limited to intersection of Venn diagram - features available in Data Studio platform and my knowledge of those features. 

Out of 4 types of company data released by MCA, viz., Indian Private Limited, Foreign Private Limited, Indian Limited Liability and Foreign Limited Liability, the dashboard is currently available for Indian Limited Liability Partnership Companies only. Dashboards for other types of company is planned for but not scheduled yet. Any contribution in creation of other dashboards or addition of visualization to existing dashboard is welcome.
